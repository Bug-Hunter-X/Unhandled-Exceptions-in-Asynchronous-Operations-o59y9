# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  unhandled exceptions during asynchronous operations. The `bug.dart` file shows code that catches exceptions but doesn't properly handle them, potentially leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved exception handling.

## Problem
The initial code attempts to fetch data from a remote API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, the `rethrow` statement simply propagates the exception up the call stack without providing any useful context or recovery mechanism.  In a real-world application, this could result in silent failures or crashes.

## Solution
The solution showcases more robust exception handling. Instead of just rethrowing, the improved code logs a more informative error message, and could implement strategies like retry mechanisms or fallback methods to enhance the user experience and application resilience.
